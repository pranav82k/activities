## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Project Overview

## Web

In this project, we have three type of users
1. Super Admin
2. Admin
3. Users


Once project have been downloaded, we have to run the migration after setup database connection.
We will have a seeder for users table that will create one Super Admin and Admin.
From Super Admin, we can create Admins as much we need and also have some basic operations like deletion and change password.
From Admin, we have below main sections
- Dashboad
- Users
- Activities
- User Activities

Dashboard - Showing some stats along with full that display the list of activities we have.
Users - We can perform basic CRUD operation from here.
Activities - We have authority to create, update of globall activity. Each acitiviy will going to add to the users we have in our system.
User Activities - We can add, edit activity related to users only.

Note - If any global activity that assigned to user will be edited from user activites will not going to be reflect globally.


## APIS
Apis is basically related to users process.
We will have the following main APIs
- User Registration
- User Login
- User Logout
- User Profile
- User Profile Updation
- User Change Password
- User's weekly activities List


I am using the custom auth, where a random token will generate every time user is logged in successfully. All the logged in process will be done on the behalf of token as token is directly linked to user, can easily extract user data from it. The main reason behind custom auth method is to increase the flexibility like if we need to add some particular things related to particular device. we can simply add the fields as per our requirement as this approach fully support multi device.
